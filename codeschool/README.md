# Code school

This repository contains examples and my personal summaries of the code school e-learning I've attended.  


Instead of wasting too many hours in none effective search over Internet, I chose to go through e-learning platforms instead. 
By far code school is the best I've found !! 

They offer VERY good tutorials and a really efficient way to test your skills as you learn them.
